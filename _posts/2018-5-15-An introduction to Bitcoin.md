There is tremendous interest in the cryptocurrency space right now and equal parts confusion, uncertainty and doubt. Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, ICOs. What do these even mean? The natural response to these foreign concepts is usually skepticism and rejection, but beneath the jargon lies a powerful new technology revamping our financial system.

There is tremendous interest in the cryptocurrency space right now and equal parts confusion, uncertainty and doubt. Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, ICOs. What do these even mean? The natural response to these foreign concepts is usually skepticism and rejection, but beneath the jargon lies a powerful new technology revamping our financial system.

Bitcoin started as an experiment in the depths of the global Financial Crisis of 2008 aiming to build a better financial system. Early on, cryptocurrencies developed a seedy undertone as they were mainly associated with black market trades: drug deals, ransomware payments, money laundering and tax evasion. Cryptocurrency has been described as the most disruptive technology since the internet as well as a fraud or a massive Ponzi scheme.

The pundits say it is a speculative bubble, but that’s simply an easy out for those who have failed to find the proper explanations. They have the merits to ask the right questions, but ultimately fail to identify the main reasons behind the fast-growing appetite for cryptocurrency. Bitcoin and other cryptoassets are an emerging new asset class experiencing rapid growth as a fundamentally innovative new technology.

We live in a digital era where the new generation prefers to trust the “abstract,” question traditional norms and find a better way forward through technology. Bitcoin brings a multifunctional financial utility to the world by creating an open financial system and allowing us to store and transact value in ways that we never thought imaginable before.
